### Client-Server Architecture
* Client -> is like the front end where users need to interact with the servers, Client can be web app, mobile app, etc.
	* Client: requests some data from Server 
* Servers -> Here we create the REST API's which can be used by the client
	* in return to the client's request Server sends the response to the client
	* In betweeen the client and server there is the data exchange takes place.

### [[REST]]
* REST is used to create the web
* RE -> representational -> format e.g: JSON, XML, 
* S -> State -> Data
* T -> Transfer -> transfer b/w two parties i.e,  client and server
