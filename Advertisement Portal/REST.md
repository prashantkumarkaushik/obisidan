## REST
* REST stands for Representational state transfer

## REST Guidelines
* ==Client-Server Architecture== 
	* which means that Client and server applications can be created in diferent language.
	* They should not be same
*  ==Stateless==
	* means that server should not store anything.
	* All the data should be stored in client application
* ==Cacheable==
	* If a data is being asked several times, then Server can create a cache of these kind of data through which data can be easily accessable
	* This will increase the perfomance
* ==Layered Architecture==

* ==Uniform Interface==
	* All the interaction must be in a unified manner
* ==Code on demand (optional)==
